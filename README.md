# Regression--youtube
This is a youtuber's channel dataset, who has now more than 700k subscribers.
When she at first opened her own channel, she had to struggle with how to attract more subscribers or to maximize monetizing from her channel. I hope this dataset is useful for someone else who wants to learn ML and Data Analysis.

Interest & Inspirations
Is it possible to predict a daily revenue of a certain youtuber with his/her channel's daily view, subscribers gained, average viewed duration, etcâ€¦?
Can I build a model predicting daily(monthly) revenue or daily gained subscribers using only views, the number of subscribers, likes, dislikes, comments, etc like factors we can get easily on one's youtube channel?
Which factor is most related with increasing daily Revenue?

Challenging : figure out what does some features really mean.
